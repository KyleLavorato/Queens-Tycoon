# Queen's Tycoon

#### An 8-bit Campus Simulator
---
Queen's Tycoon is an 8-bit simulation style game, where the player takes ownership of a brand new University campus. The player must run their campus successfully by building building, hiring professors and maintaining student happiness, all while avoiding **bankruptcy**. But just like in a real University Campus, the student population is hard to control, and random social trends can throw even the best planning principals for a loop. If the player can survive a whole 50 years of running their campus they can successfully enter retirement.

## Technical Background

The Queen's Tycoon game is programmed completely in C++ in an object oriented style. The game uses the [Allegro](https://liballeg.org/) C++ library to add GUI and general gameplay functionality.

## Dependencies

To compile the software, the Code::Blocks library is recommended and the Allegro game library is required to be linked. All assets and data for the game are contained in `Assets/` and `db/` respectively.

## Try the Game

The game is available in a fully compiled state in the `Build/` directory. Simply run the *PlayGame* shortcut to launch the game in a borderless environment.
